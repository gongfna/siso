                      SISO - Simple iSCSI Storage
                ****************************************

Introduction
--------------------
"SISO"(Simple iSCSI Storage) is iSCSI software target on Linux.
It is aimed at studying an iSCSI/SCSI and trying to adapt some ideas
about storage technology.

I refered code from an iSCSI Enterprise Target.


Installation
--------------------
SISO is user-land program. To build SISO:

	> make


Configuration
--------------------
SISO is configured via configuration file "siso.conf", which is
located in same directory as SISO binary.

See sample configuration file "siso.conf" for the current syntax.

Note that you must edit the configuration file before starting the
siso.


Starting
--------------------
To execute SISO:

	> siso

SISO has few command-line options. You can check these options:

	> siso -u


Stopping
--------------------
To stop SISO, press CTRL+C.


Notice
--------------------
Current version of SISO is "quick-hack".
It has these key limitations:
  - NOT support multi-connection (connection per session is 1)
  - NOT support TaskManagementFunction.
  - NOT support long-sector (e.g. 4KB/sector)
  - supported authentication method is only CHAP. (and "None")

And not implemented error-handlers.

I've verified intterconnectivity with:
  - Microsoft Initiattor w/ Windows XP Professional (32bit)
  - VMware vSphere 5.0
  - CentOS 6.2

Future Plans (Ideas)
--------------------
  - MacOS X initiator support
  - port to Microsoft Windows Server, etc.
  - Write back caching(with SSD)
  - snapshot, de-dupe, thin-provisioning
  - distributed storage,
      ....

Thank you.
